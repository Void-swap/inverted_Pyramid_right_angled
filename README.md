# About problem
The right-angled pyramid pattern consists of rows and columns, with each row representing a level or layer of the pyramid.
The first row has a single element, and each subsequent row adds one more element than the previous row.
The right-angled pyramid pattern is typically used for visually representing hierarchical data or for creating aesthetically pleasing outputs in console applications.
